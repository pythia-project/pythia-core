# This is the official list of people who have contributed
# to the Pythia project.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people. For example, UCL employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because the UCL holds the copyright.

# Names should be added to this file like so:
# Name <email address>

# Please keep the list sorted.
